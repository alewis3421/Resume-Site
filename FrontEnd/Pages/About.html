            <p>
                My name is Alexander Lewis and I'm currently a student at Texas State University. My
                major is Computer Science with a minor in Technology. I'm currently expected to graduate 
                by August 2024 and My dream after graduating would be to become a Full Stack Developer. 
                I enjoy encountering difficult problems that challenge me and require me to learn something
                new to solve them. I like being a Jack of all Trades, being able to contribute to everything
                that comes my way vastly interests me. 
            </p>
